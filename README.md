**Deep Learning for Image Analysis in Insurance: Contextualized Reading**

Welcome to the DeepInsuranceDocs repository! This project focuses on advancing the field of insurance document analysis through the application of deep learning techniques, including models such as LayoutLM and Donut. Our goal is to enhance information retrieval and understanding from insurance documents.
DeepInsuranceDocs is a research project focused on my PhD thesis. This repository serves as a centralized hub for our research code, data, and documentation, designed to enhance information retrieval in insurance documents.

## Project Structure

Our project is organized into several key directories and components:

- **code**: This directory contains the core code for data preparation, model training, and evaluation. Subdirectories are organized according to the specific tasks and models.

- **data**: Here, you can find sample datasets and data preprocessing scripts. Note that for larger datasets, instructions for obtaining the data may be provided.

- **models**: Subdirectories represent different models, each containing model-specific code and configuration files.

- **utils**: Shared data preparation utilities, evaluation metrics, and other utility scripts can be found in this directory.

- **config**: Configuration files for different models and data preparation settings are stored here.

- **results**: This directory may include model checkpoints, evaluation results, and other output files.

- **docs**: Documentation related to the research project, such as research papers, manuals, or project reports.

- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model training, and visualization are available in this directory.
